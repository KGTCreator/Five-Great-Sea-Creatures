<h4>We all know sea life, thats a given in life. Humans know what they are since their first years in school, so I won't explain them to you. Though, many have tried to narrow down the best of the best, to them anyway, to see which sea creatures are better and which ones are worse. But none of them can compare to these lot, and I'll show you why! These are the Top 5 sea creatures of all time, according to Kalen Tobin!</h4>
<h4>This website's ranking system is based on how facinating the creatures are, their design, and what they do. Once all these factors are added up, the resuolts will be revealed.</h4>
